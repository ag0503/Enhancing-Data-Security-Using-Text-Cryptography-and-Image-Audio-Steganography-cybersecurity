# Enhancing-Data-Security-Using-Text-Cryptography-and-Image-Audio-Steganography-
This project combines cryptography and steganography to provide a dual layer of data security. It employs the AES encryption algorithm to convert text data into ciphertext, which is then concealed within image or audio files using the LSB algorithm. To ensure data integrity, an enhanced encryption algorithm is employed and compared to the original file through techniques like PSNR, MSE, and histogram analysis. Additionally, steganography ensures the hidden message's existence remains undetectable, minimizing the risk of data tampering.
